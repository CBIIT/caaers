Feature: caAERS will provide interfaces and methods for the messaging of AEs to systems external to the local adopter. We anticipate that this will include two-way communication of adverse events with cooperative groups, national studies, study sponsors, the NCI and the FDA.
 	Background: 
 		Given the caAERS system is integrated with AdEERS
 		
 	Scenario: Submit an expedited safety report to AdEERS for an "Agent Only" CTEP sponsored trial
 	Given I am logged in as an Adverse Event Report
 	And I have imported study "RTOG-0417"
 	And "Fox Chase Cancer Center (PA086)" is a study site
 	And data entry is complete for the study
 	And I am authorized on the study for which the report is submitted
 	And I have recorded an adverse event for "Grade 3, Dehydration"
 	And "Donald Duck" is a study subject
 	When I am on the Manage Reports screen
 	And I enter "RTOG-0417" in the Study field
 	Then I see "A Phase II Study of Bevacizumab in Combination with Definitive Radiotherapy and Cisplatin Chemotherapy in Untreated Patients with Locally Advanced Cervical Carcinoma" in the search results"
 	When I select "A Phase II Study of Bevacizumab in Combination with Definitive Radiotherapy and Cisplatin Chemotherapy in Untreated Patients with Locally Advanced Cervical Carcinoma"
 	Then the study field is populated with "A Phase II Study of Bevacizumab in Combination with Definitive Radiotherapy and Cisplatin Chemotherapy in Untreated Patients with Locally Advanced Cervical Carcinoma"
 	When I enter "Donald Duck" in the Subject field
 	Then I see "Donald Duck" in the search results
 	When I select "Donald Duck"
 	Then the subject field is populated with "Donald Duck"
 	When I click the 'Continue' button
 	Then I am taken to the "AE List" page
 	When I click "Actions"
 	And I click 'Edit Adverse Event'
 	Then I am taken to step 2 of the capture routine AEs flow
 	When I click the 'Save & Report' button
 	Then I am taken to step 3 of the capture routine AEs flow
 	When I click the 'Report' button
 	Then I am taken to step 1 of the Expedited Report flow
 	When I enter only mandatory information on for steps 1 - 10 of the Expedited Report flow
 	Then on the 'Review and Submit' screen "Physician sign-off is mandatory for this report." should be the only validation message I see
 	When I click the checkbox next to "I certify that this report has been reviewed and approved by a physician or his/her medically certified designee responsible for the care of this patient."
 	Then I should see a "Ready to Submit" message displayed
 	When I click the 'Submit' button 
 	Then I should be taken to the '1. Submitter' screen
 	And the checkbox next to "If the submitter is the same as the reporter" should be checked
 	When I click the "Save & Continue" button
 	Then I should be taken to the '2. Recipients' screen
 	When I click the 'Submit' button 
 	Then I should be taken to the '3. Submission Status' screen
 	And see the message "Submission in Progress" displayed
 	When I refresh the '3. Submission Status' screen
 	Then I should see the message "Submitted successfully on [current date]"
