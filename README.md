Welcome to the caAERS Project!
=====================================

The caBIGÂ® Adverse Event Reporting System (caAERS) is an open source software project that is used to record and report
adverse events that occur during clinical trials.
It is a JSP based web application written in Java using Hibernate and Spring technologies.
The goal of caAERS is to support regulatory and protocol compliance for adverse event reporting and allow local collection, management, 
and querying of adverse event data. It also supports service based integration of data from other clinical trials management systems.
