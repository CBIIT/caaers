# The default logic of deriving HELP key in TabWithFields.java is "viewName" + "." + propertyName, 
# where / (forward slash) character in viewName is replaced with a . (dot) and array notations[x] 
# in propertyName removed .  
#Eg:
# So for in general for a page identified by study/study_sites (identified by 'viewName' of a Tab)
# and for text input property studySites[1].name, the auto generated help key will be
# study.study_sites.studySites.name
