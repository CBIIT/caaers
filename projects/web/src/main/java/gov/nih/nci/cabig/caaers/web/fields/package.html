<h2>Goal</h2>

Provides an object model for HTML form fields.  Fields are aggregated into tab definitions
using the {@link TabWithFields} {@link Tab} subclass.  Modeling & aggregating form fields this
way makes it easy to a) move fields between tabs by making changes in a single place and b) avoid
boilerplate HTML in the tabs' views.

The base interface is {@link InputField}.

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>
    InputFields are divided into categories.  The implementation of aggregation (see
    {@link RepeatingFieldGroupFactory} and {@link CompositeField}) involves several
    wrapper classes.  For this reason, there is not one implementation per category,
    with specialized behavior in each category-implementing class.  (If it were implemented
    so, there would need to be a new subclass for each category for each distinct
    type of wrapping.)
</p><p>
    Instead, there is a main class {@link DefaultInputField} and a factory
    {@link InputFieldFactory}.  Specialized per-category properties are stored in
    the {@link InputField#getAttributes attributes} map for the field.  Known keys
    for the attributes are defined in {@link InputField} itself.
    {@link InputFieldAttributes} provides type-safe helpers for setting the known attributes.
